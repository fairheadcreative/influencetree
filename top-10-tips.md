## Have you ever wondered what life would be like if people sought you out specifically for your expertise?

Imagine for a second.

* If you could name your own price for your services
* If you could have people line up to work with you
* If you could land better clients or the job you have always imagined having
* If you were seen as a thought leader in your industry
* If people were to specifically seek you out for your services
* If people lined up to pay you for your services because of how powerful your brand is
* It would be nice, wouldn’t it?

What kind of impact would that have to your career? Your income? Your life-long career plan to success?

What if I were to tell you that I can put a proven system in your hands to do all that.

It doesn’t matter where you are today, whether you’re just staring your career or halfway through it… There is only one way to build — and that is up. That way is our InfluenceTree course.

Before I even started the InfluenceTree course, people were able to mimic my success.

> I saw you get millions of views on you writing and how it was getting into all these publications. I figured that I could do the same thing, so I reverse engineered your success by writing posts in the same format. You helped me hit the same milestones you did like surpassing [10 million views](https://www.quora.com/profile/Nicolas-Cole-1), getting major media features and my own Inc. column.
