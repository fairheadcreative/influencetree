    <h1 class="subheading">Education is Fragmented.<br>We are not.</h1>
    <p>Self help courses are all the rage.</p>
    <p>But they suffer from a major problem.</p>
    <p>See, the education industry is so fragmented, it’s hard to <em>actually learn what you need</em> AND get practical help applying it!</p>
    <p>But what does that mean?</p>
    <p>Compare it to starting an online business…</p>
    <p>Before you can even launch, there’s lots of "stuff" to do.</p>
    <p>You’d need to:</p>
    <ul class="point">
      <li>Find a Web domain from Godaddy.</li>
      <li>Build your site on some platform (like WordPress).</li>
      <li>Hire a graphic designer or programmer to build out what you can’t make on your site.</li>
      <li>Find another vendor to accept your payments from your customers.</li>
      <li>Source your way to get inventory from another vendor or create your own.</li>
      <li>Manage your finances through Quickbooks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is what we call fragmentation, and it’s KILLING the education industry!</p> 

    <h2>Okay…<br>How’s that apply to personal branding courses?</h2>
    <p>Two things happen with regular educational programs:</p>
    <ul class="point">
      <li>People sign up for courses.</li>
      <li>They learn skills.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So far so good.</p>
    <p>But what do they do with them after they learn?</p>
    <ul class="downer">
      <li>They go back to doing what they were already doing.</li>
      <li>They turn into "professionl students", addicted to programs.</li>
      <li>They learn the skills and move on.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Less than a quarter of people <em>actually go out there and do something</em> with the education they gather.</p>
    <p>Crazy, right?</p>
    <p>Think about it… This means there’s a <strong>huge</strong> disconnect between "teaching valuable skills" and "helping people take action".</p>
    <p>Most of the time, students still don’t know the answers to crucial questions:</p>
    <ul class="questions">
      <li>What should I do first/next?</li>
      <li>Which tools should I use?</li>
      <li>Am I making progress?</li>
      <li>But what do I <em>DO?</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ever asked yourself one of <em>those</em> questions?</p> 

    <h2>Heck yeah.<br>So what’s different about you guys?</h2>

    <p>We’re different because we’ve <em>been there</em>.</p>
    <p>We’ve seen all the courses you’ve seen… probably more.</p>
    <p>We’ve watched others (and ourselves) <em>not</em> get the results that those courses promised.</p>
    <p>We’ve felt the frustrations first-hand. <strong>And we know how to remove them</strong></p>
    <p>Education’s not enough. We need to take action.</p>
    <p>InfluenceTree not only helps teach you how to build your brand, our course outline helps you build your influence as you learn:</p>
    <ul class="answers">
      <li>Our advisors guide you in refining your online &amp; offline presence,</li>
      <li>We give you weekly assignments that you can implement immediately,</li>
      <li>We help curate your content to become publish-worthy,</li>
      <li><strong>We show you how to grow your audience.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Best part? You can take it at your own pace. No pressure.</p>
    <p>As long as you're taking action.</p>
    <p><a class="button course-open" href="javascript:void(0);">Get started &rarr;</a></p>

    <h2>How to get paid while you learn</h2>
    <p>By definition, an influencer is someone who has credibility in their field and has a social media following of at least 10,000 people. Our goal is to help you become an influencer <strong>within one year of being with InfluenceTree.</strong></p>
    <p>Finding a sponsor to amplify your voice as an influencer is as hard as building your personal brand, if not harder. InfluenceTree partners with major brands across the brand to help you succeed. After we help you become an influencer, you don’t have to go out there and search for sponsors. <em>Instead, we bring them to you.</em></p>
    <p>More on that after you’ve signed up, though. This is like nothing you’ve ever seen before.</p>
  
    <h2>Let’s get real: Stop wasting time with programs that don't work</h2>
    <p>Personal branding courses are like fruit machines in Vegas.</p>
    <p>At least, they used to be.</p>
    <p>If you’ve gone out there and tried to do it on your own, you know just how hard it really is. All the odds are against you. Even with the proper education, just getting started can be overwhelming.</p>
    <p>Why do it the hard way when you can do it the easy way? Wouldn’t you rather have someone hold your hand and walk you through the process until you can monetize your content?</p>
    <p>InfluenceTree is kind of like having an inside man watching the cameras in the sky room at the casino, looking down on the hands of each player. With that kind of insight:</p>
    <ul class="answers">
      <li>No longer do you have to dig aimlessly,</li>
      <li>No longer do you have to carry all the risk,</li>
      <li>No longer do you have to put all your efforts in a broken system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With InfluenceTree, you have a birds-eye view of the industry. You have insights showing you exactly what is going on. You know where the gold is.</p>
