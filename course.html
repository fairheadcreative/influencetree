    <h2 class="hero__title">Fragmented education makes learning harder.</h2>
    <p>Self help courses are all the rage. However, the education industry is so fragmented, it’s hard to actually learn what you need AND get practical help applying it.</p>
    <p>But what does that mean?</p>
    <p>Let’s compare it to making an online business. Before you can even launch your online business, you have to go through multiple vendors.</p>
    <p>You were forced to:</p>
    <ul class="downer">
      <li>Find a Web domain from Godaddy</li>
      <li>Build your site on some platform (like WordPress)</li>
      <li>Hire a graphic designer or programmer to build out what you can’t make on your site</li>
      <li>Find another vendor to accept your payments from your customers</li>
      <li>Source your way to get inventory from another vendor or create your own</li>
      <li>Manage your finances through Quickbooks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is what we call fragmentation, and it’s KILLING the education industry!</p> 

    <h2>How does that apply to personal branding courses?</h2>
    <p>Two things happen with regular educational programs:</p>
    <ul class="point">
      <li>People sign up for courses</li>
      <li>They learn skills</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But what do they do with them after they learn?</p>
    <ul class="downer">
      <li>They go back to doing what they were already doing</li>
      <li>They turn into self help buffers addicted to programs</li>
      <li>They learn the skills and move on</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Very few people actually go out there and do something with the education they gather. This means there’s a huge disconnect between teaching valuable skills and helping people put them into action. Most often, students still don’t know the answers to crucial questions:</p>
    <ul class="questions">
      <li>Where do I work?</li>
      <li>What do I do?</li>
      <li>How do I build?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instead, students are left to figure out the next step for themselves, leading many to go back to the ineffective techniques they were using before, spend more on a different program, or moving onto something else.</p> 

    <h2>What is different about InfluenceTree?</h2>

    <p>In such a fragmented and broken industry like online education, InfluenceTree pieces together what education is truly meant to do:</p>
    <p><strong>Bring about tangible results.</strong></p>
    <p>People like us, we all want to <strong>build</strong> our personal or business brands. We want to be seen as <strong>experts</strong> in our industry. We want <strong>paying</strong> clients. In trying to fulfill this need, we seek out information and education to become better, to separate ourselves from the crowd.</p>
    <p>But education is not enough. We also need to take <strong>action</strong> upon the skills we acquire.</p>
    <p>InfluenceTree not only helps teach you how to build your brand, our course outline helps you build your influence as you learn:</p>
    <ul class="answers">
      <li>We <strong>have</strong> advisors who guide you in refining your online and offline presence</li>
      <li>We <strong>give</strong> you weekly assignments that you can implement immediately</li>
      <li>We <strong>help</strong> curate your content to become publish worthy</li>
      <li><strong>We show you how to grow your audience</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>But if that’s too much for you, then we give you options. You can just learn on your own, or you can hire our experts to do the work for you.</p>

    <h2>Why being an influencer means growing your business.</h2>
    <p>As an influencer, your goal is to share your <strong>messages</strong>. To share your <strong>vision</strong>. To share your expertise. To be <strong>thought leaders</strong> in your respective field. But ultimately, it is to build a secondary, or even a new primary <strong>income stream</strong>.</p>
    <p>Companies are changing the way they advertise. They are moving away from doing the traditional methods of advertising. Now, they’re seeking out new influencers, such as yourself to help spread their message.</p>
    <p>When you become an influencer, you can partner with companies to expand your or your brand’s personal audience and establish greater industry authority. Naturally, this means higher profits for you and your business.</p>
  
    <h2>InfluenceTree gets you paid as you learn.</h2>
    <p>By definition, an influencer is someone who has credibility in their field and has a social media following of at least 10,000 people. <strong>Our goal is to help you become an influencer within one year of being with InfluenceTree.</strong></p>
    <p>Finding a sponsor to amplify your voice as an influencer is as hard as building your personal brand, if not harder. <strong>InfluenceTree partners with major brands across the world to help you succeed.</strong> After we help you become an influencer, you don’t have to go out there and search for sponsors. Instead, we bring them to you.</p>

    <h2>Stop wasting time on programs that don’t work.</h2>
    <p>Without InfluenceTree, if you were to go out and build your brand on your own, it would almost be as if you were gambling in Vegas.</p>
    <p>If you’ve gone out there and tried to do it on your own, you know just how hard it really is. Quite frankly, all the odds are against you. Even with the proper education, just getting started can be overwhelming.</p>
    <p>But why should you face the dilemmas of building a brand on your own? Wouldn’t you rather have someone hold your hand and walk you through the process until you can monetize your content?</p>
    <p>InfluenceTree is kind of like having an inside man watching the cameras in the sky room at the casino, looking down on the hands of each player. With that kind of insight:</p>

    <ul class="answers">
      <li>No longer do you have to dig aimlessly</li>
      <li>No longer do you have to carry all the risk</li>
      <li>No longer do you have to put all your efforts in a fragmented system</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why even take such a risk of trying to do it on your own, where you put in absolutely everything you have, for such a low chance of success?</p>
    <p>With InfluenceTree, we have a bird’s eye view on the industry. We have the insights of exactly what is going on. We even know where the gold is.</p>
    <p>So, why should you go out there to figure out your own path? Especially now, when that path can be laid out for you.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">What we do</h2>
    <p>We build your influence. Our team has a track record of proven success in growing both personal and business brands. We share all our secrets with you.</p>
    <h3>Position Your Brand</h3>
    <p>We are complex creatures. We are like onions, with multiple layers that define who we are. Because of that, many people don’t know how to make their brand stick. Or they can’t identify what they want to be known for. We help you get through that clutter and refine the position of your brand.</p>
    <h3>Build Your Following</h3>
    <p>Positioning your brand means nothing without an audience to engage with you, your company, or your products and services. We either teach you how to build your own audience or we can do everything for you.</p>
    <h3>Engage your Audience</h3>
    <p>Once you have a message to share and an audience ready to listen to what you have to say, we help you refine your message. This allows you to engage with your audience. That engagement leads to raving fans, strategic partnerships and sales that will expand your business.</p>
