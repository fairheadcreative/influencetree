    <h1 class="subheading">Just two average people, <span>showing you how we cracked the code.</span></h1>
    <p>Hey, itâ€™s Leonard and Ryan here ðŸ˜„  Question for you.</p>
    <p>Have you ever thoughtâ€¦</p>
    <ul class="questions">
      <li>How do I get get clients to <strong>notice me</strong>?</li>
      <li>How do I get people to come to <strong>me</strong> for my expertise?</li>
      <li>How do I get <strong>respect</strong> for the work I do?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>You may have been searching for these answers, but have you found them yet?</strong></p>
    <p>Donâ€™t worry. We get it. We know exactly just how hard it is to build something up, especially in the digital age.</p>
    <p>Weâ€™ve both started companies and have tried absolutely everything to generate business revenue, from cold calls to knocking on doors to trying every single thing possible on the Internet. </p>
    <p>Most of what we did failedâ€¦</p>
    <p><strong>Miserably.</strong></p>
    <p>But through the process, we cracked the code.</p>
    <p>We discovered:</p>
    <ul class="answers">
      <li>How to get clients to come to us while we put in the least amount of work. </li>
      <li>How to get recognized by the top media publications in the world and get them to showcase our expertise.</li>
      <li>How to to get hundreds of thousands of people to engage with what we have created online.</li>
      <li>And itâ€™s time, for us to share all our secrets with YOU.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Weâ€™ve come up with a step-by-step personal branding course, that will take you from virtually no online footprint to crushing it on the internet. And it works.</p>
    <p>How do we know it works? We built our own brands. Then people kept asking us how we did it. So we started to share the exact process, and they started to see success with the process.</p>
    <p>These comprehensive steps have been tried, tested and proven to build your personal brand to the level it needs to be at.</p>
    <p>However, building a strong brand does not happen overnight.</p>
    <p>Much like a sunflower, it takes much nurturing and tender loving care to grow.</p>
    <p>Now hereâ€™s the thing. We practice what we preach. And we are ready to share with you the exact process and steps we have taken ourselves to showcase our expertise through our personal brands.</p>
    <p>But this isnâ€™t for everyone. If you want to get rich quick, go find a multi level marketing company to join. If you want to sit at home and do nothing, go invest in options. If you want to work so you can create a lifelong reputation and income stream, then you are the type of person we are looking for.</p>
    <p>We understand that no two people are in the exact same position in life, and thatâ€™s why we want to learn more about where you are at, so that we can quickly determine if and how we are able to help you. </p>
    <p>The first step to discovering if you are right for our course is to take our Influence Scoreâ„¢ quiz. This quiz will show you where you stand with your brand. Who knows. You may already be a pro and you just donâ€™t know it yet. Or maybe you have absolutely no idea where to start. Or youâ€™re somewhere in between. </p>
